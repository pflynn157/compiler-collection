## OOTO Compiler Collection

Welcome to the OOTO compiler collection. This is a collection of various experimental and domain-specific programming languages meant to explore and solve specific problems.

However, this is not just a collection of languages. This is meant to be a complete compiler collection. Many of the languages use LLVM for the backend, but we also have in-development sub-projects meant to be replacements for any external dependencies.

Here is our current project list:
* as -> Assemblers for various architectures (current x86 and RISC-V).
* compiler -> A library for generalizing our frontends to various backends
* libelf -> Utilities for the ELF binary file format.
* llir -> A homebrew compiler backend modeled after LLVM.
* test -> The test system
* tiny-lang -> The first language, a mini educational language
* sal-lang -> Set Algorithmic Language- A language based on formal set theory with heavy emphasis on math.
